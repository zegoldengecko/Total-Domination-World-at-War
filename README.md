TOTAL DOMINATION: WORLD AT WAR

OVERVIEW
This is a turn-based grand-strategy game built in Python using the Pygame library.
This was the first large scale project I created - a high-school project that became a complex World War II-style simulator where you control a nation, manage its economy and engage in diplomacy, warfare and long-term strategic planning.
Whilst this project is old, it represents a major milestone in my early development journey.

CORE FEATURES
- Playable Nations --> (choose from multiple countries each with unique stats and bonuses)
- AI-Driven World Simulation --> AI nations make decisions, conduct diplomacy, trade resources, build armies and evaluate threats and opportunites.
- Complex Economic System --> Nations produce resources and engage in trade. Economic strength affects military production and national decisions
- Diplomacy System --> The AI and players can form alliances and negotiate trades. The AI reacts dynamically to player actions
- Military Mechanics --> Train armies, move troops, combat calulcations determine battle outcomes and strategic positioning matters.
- National Focus System --> Nations choose long-term strategic goals which provide bonuses and shape behaviour.
- Turn Based Gameplay --> Each turn represents a strategic cycle as AI and player actions resolve sequentially

TECH STACK
- Language: Python
- Framework: Pygame
- AI Logic: Custom decision making algorithm
- Data Structures: Dictionaries, lists, classes

REQUIREMENTS
- Python
- Pygame library (pip install pygame)

WHAT I LEARNED
- Building AI decision-making systems
- Designing a turn based simulation loop
- Managing complex game state
- Implementing diplomacy, economy and combat systems
- Structuring a large project in Python
- Balancing gameplay mechanics

NOTES
This was my first ever large scale project. Expect bugs, unpolished UI, rough logic and messy code.
